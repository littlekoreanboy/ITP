* Neuropeptide and Receptors are known as "Lock" and "Key" mechanism where a specific Key can only unlock a specific Lock. Therefore in terms of Neuropeptide and Receptors, a specific Neuropeptide can only modulate the activity of a Receptor that is specific for that Neuropeptide
* Protostomes and Deuterostomes can be rounghly described as Invertebrates vs Vertebrates. Take for example : Flies are invertebrates, because they lack a spinal column, and Humans are vertebrates, because we have a spinal column
* Protostomes and Deuterostomes are the 2 major clades (groups) of bilaterians: bilaterally symmetrical animals
* In co-evolution, neuropeptide ITP and its receptor ITPR SHOULD have evolved together due to their interdependence, where changes in one likely drive adaptations in the other
* It is known that Invertebrates express ITP. So to identify the receptor for ITP, we will find receptors that are only found in invertebrates. ITPR gene has not been identified. Therefore finding ITPR sequence is important
* The conserved amino-acid cysteines are found in all ITP. Specifically, there are 6 cysteine residues

## Project Task - (Timeline : 10/3/2024 - 10/7/2024)
```bash
# Our Goal is to BLAST search 20 ITP protein sequences for each arthropod order. We will use Multiple Sequence Alignment to access their evolutionary relationship, common patterns, and conservation
